                A strategic leader in the global sports industry, I have over 30
                years of experience navigating the complexities of the Olympic
                and sports ecosystems. Known for bold thinking and a
                results-driven approach, I connect brands, people, and ideas
                around shared values to build impactful, innovative sponsorship
                programs. Across 15 Olympic Games, I have partnered with
                National Olympic Committees, Olympic Marketing Partners,
                broadcasters, Organizing Committees, and National Federations,
                leveraging strategic insights to deliver integrated platforms
                that include objective-driven activations, experiential events,
                hospitality, and operational programs.

                As a senior leader in Partnership Marketing with the United
                States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee, I developed and

                Coca-Cola, P&amp;G, Visa, Budweiser, Hilton, Samsung, GE, and
                Kelloggâ€™s. My strategic vision helped these brands achieve
                measurable outcomes, strengthen global visibility, and create
                lasting connections with audiences. I am a visionary leader
                dedicated to fostering a culture of transparency,
                accountability, courage, and trust, helping individuals and
                teams reach their highest potential.
